## Dev

```
node : v18.20.0
npm  : 10.5.0
os   : Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
mysql: 8.0.36-0ubuntu0.22.04.1

```

## Description

```
We need BlockExplore in our local development environment because it's too hard and time-consuming to manually request all the API data to the browser to see it, so to compensate for that shortcoming, I made the local devnet data viewable with Explore.

```
